# Cryptography Portfolio

In this portfolio, I will be showcasing and explaining all code pertaining to any cryptography that I have learned, along with test files and how to run them. 

Number theory is an abstract concept, and most poeple think that something so abstract can't possibly be useful, and this is why it's so intriguing to me. It's really hard to get started but once you understand the theory behind it, there are vast applications of it all around the world.
